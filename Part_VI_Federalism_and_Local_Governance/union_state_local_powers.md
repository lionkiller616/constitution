# Union, State, and Local Division of Powers

## 1. Introduction

A well-functioning federal system ensures that powers and responsibilities are **clearly distributed** among different levels of government.  
The Republic of Equality adopts a **cooperative, yet constitutionally defined federal structure**.

## 2. Three-Tier Government Structure

### c. Local Governments
- Urban: **Municipalities**
- Rural: **Panchayati Raj Institutions**

## 3. Constitutional Division of Powers

The Constitution defines **three lists** to distribute legislative and executive powers:

### 🔹 Union List (Exclusive to Union)
- Defense, foreign affairs, atomic energy, banking, railways, citizenship, etc.

### 🔸 State List (Exclusive to States)
- Police, public health, agriculture, local law enforcement, markets, land, etc.

### 🟢 Concurrent List (Shared Jurisdiction)
- Education, forests, marriage/divorce, electricity, labor, environmental protection

> In case of conflict on Concurrent subjects, **Union law prevails**, unless the State law has Presidential assent.

## 4. Residuary Powers

- Any subject **not listed** in the three lists goes to the **Union Government**
- This ensures that **emerging issues (e.g., cybersecurity, AI regulation)** can be handled nationally

## 6. Intergovernmental Coordination

### a. Inter-State Council

## 7. Autonomy with Accountability

- Each level must respect the **functional autonomy** of the other
- Strong **checks and balances** prevent overreach by the Union or State

> Local governments are constitutionally empowered, not just delegated, and must receive predictable funding and legal protection.

---

## 8. Constitutional Safeguards

- Parliament cannot arbitrarily dismiss State Governments without **justified Constitutional breakdown**
- No level can **override the basic structure**: democracy, federalism, equality, and dignity

---

It empowers each level to serve its people effectively while upholding unity and constitutional integrity.

> “True democracy flows from every village and rises to the Union — not the other way around.”
