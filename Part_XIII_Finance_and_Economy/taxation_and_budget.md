# Taxation and Budget

## 1. Principles of Taxation

The taxation system shall be:

- **Equitable**: Based on ability to pay, ensuring fairness across income groups
- **Progressive**: Higher incomes shall bear proportionately higher tax responsibility
- **Transparent**: All taxes must be clearly defined by law, with no hidden levies
- **Accountable**: Tax funds must be used solely for public welfare

## 2. Types of Taxes

- **Union Taxes**: Levied by the central government (e.g., income tax, customs duties, corporate tax)
- **State Taxes**: Levied by states (e.g., land revenue, agricultural tax, state GST)
- **Shared Taxes**: Goods and Services Tax (GST), with a clearly defined revenue-sharing mechanism
- **Local Taxes**: Property tax, user fees, collected by local governments for local needs

## 3. Budget Process

- **Annual Financial Statement (Union and States)** must be presented before the Legislature
- **Budget Components**:
  - Receipts (tax and non-tax)
  - Expenditure (plan and non-plan)

## 4. Budgeting Ethics

- No expenditure shall be incurred without legislative approval
- All estimates must be:
