# Termination and Renunciation of Citizenship

## 1. Voluntary Renunciation

Any citizen of the Republic may voluntarily renounce their citizenship by submitting a formal declaration to the relevant authority. Upon acceptance of this declaration:

- The person shall cease to be a citizen of the Republic.
- The renunciation shall not absolve the individual of legal obligations incurred during citizenship.
- If the individual holds dual or multiple citizenships, they must disclose such status during renunciation.

## 2. Termination by Conduct

Citizenship of any individual may be terminated under the following conditions:

- **Acquisition of Citizenship of a Foreign State**: Any citizen who voluntarily acquires the citizenship of another country shall cease to be a citizen of the Republic.

  - Engages in acts of terrorism or war against the Republic,
  - Supports violent overthrow of the constitutional government,
  - Provides material assistance to enemy states during war,
  - Joins any foreign armed forces without permission of the Republic.

> Note: No termination shall occur without due process of law and the right to appeal.

## 3. Safeguards Against Statelessness

No person shall be rendered stateless by termination or renunciation unless:

- Holds or is eligible for citizenship of another country.

The Republic shall make efforts to prevent and remedy cases of statelessness in accordance with international human rights obligations.
