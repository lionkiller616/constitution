# Equal Opportunity and Public Welfare

## 1. Introduction

The Constitution of the Republic of Equality affirms that every citizen deserves a **fair chance** to grow, contribute, and prosper — regardless of background or birth.  
It directs the State to ensure **equal opportunity** in all spheres of life and to actively promote **public welfare**, so that justice is not confined to law but extended to **daily life**.

This Directive Principle binds the State to be not only a lawmaker, but a **guardian of human potential**.

- Prevent the concentration of wealth and privilege in the hands of a few

Equality of opportunity includes **equality of starting point**.

The Constitution prohibits:

- Decentralized, community-managed funds and public works
- Recognition and promotion of **informal sector contributions**

The State shall create **a society where dignity is not for sale, and opportunity is not inherited**.

## 8. Affirmation

> “Where you are born must never decide who you can become.”

Equal opportunity and public welfare are not matters of policy — they are **foundations of justice**.

The Republic of Equality stands for a future where **success is earned, not inherited**, and **welfare is shared, not politicized**.
