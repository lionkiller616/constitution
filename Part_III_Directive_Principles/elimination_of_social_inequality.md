# Elimination of Social Inequality

## 1. Introduction

The Republic of Equality recognizes that **centuries of structural discrimination**—based on caste, gender, class, tribe, disability, religion, color, and identity—have led to deeply embedded **social inequality**.

This part of the Constitution mandates **proactive, enforceable steps** to **eliminate all forms of social hierarchy, exclusion, and injustice**.

Social equality is not just a moral ideal — it is a **constitutional obligation**.

**No citizen** shall be treated as inferior due to:

## 7. Affirmation

> “Until the lowest is free, none of us are truly equal.”

The Constitution declares that **casteism, sexism, racism, and exclusion** are not culture — they are injustice.

To eliminate social inequality is not an act of charity.  
It is the **constitutional duty** of the people and the government.

Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity shall **not be slogans**, but **lived realities** — in every village, home, street, and institution.
