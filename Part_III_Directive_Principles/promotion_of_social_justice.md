# Promotion of Social Justice and Unity

## 1. Introduction

The Republic of Equality is founded on the principle that **no society can be truly free unless it is also fair**.  
Social justice means more than laws — it is about **dignity in practice**, **equality in opportunity**, and **unity in diversity**.

This directive mandates the State to actively dismantle injustice and ensure that every individual, regardless of caste, class, religion, gender, or ability, is treated as **equal in worth and power**.

## 2. Constitutional Mandate

The Constitution directs the State to:

- End all forms of **social exclusion and discrimination**
- Promote active **inclusion of marginalized communities** in national life
- Ensure that justice is **corrective, distributive, and transformative**

Justice is not only retributive — it is restorative and preventive.
