# Core Rights Cannot Be Suspended — Even in Emergency

## 1. Fundamental Principle

In the **Republic of Equality**, some rights are so essential to human dignity and democracy that **no emergency — military, civil, financial, or political — can override or suspend them** under any condition.

These rights are called **“Non-Derogable Core Rights.”**

---

## 2. List of Non-Derogable Core Rights

Even during war, rebellion, or extreme crisis, the following rights shall remain **fully protected and enforceable**:

### a. Right to Equality before the Law
- No discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, color, language, identity, class, or opinion

### b. Right to Life and Personal Liberty
- Protection from arbitrary arrest, detention, or execution
- No enforced disappearances or extra-judicial killings

### c. Right to Dignity and Humane Treatment
- Prohibition of torture, slavery, servitude, and inhuman punishment

### d. Right to Constitutional Remedies
- Uninterrupted access to the judiciary to challenge violations

### e. Rights of Children
- Right to protection from harm, hunger, displacement, trafficking, or forced recruitment

### f. Freedom of Thought and Conscience

## 3. Legal Guarantee

- These rights are **immune to any form of suspension, modification, or restriction**
- Parliament cannot amend or suspend them, even by two-thirds majority
- The **Supreme Court shall act as permanent guardian** of these rights, with suo-motu powers during emergencies

---

## 4. Emergency Doctrine Limitations

- Any law, executive order, or emergency regulation that **violates these core rights** shall be:
  - **Automatically void and unenforceable**
  - Subject to immediate review by a Constitutional Bench

- **Military tribunals** or **emergency courts** have **no authority** to adjudicate on these rights

---

## 5. International Foundations

This clause is inspired by global human rights standards:
- **Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**
- **German Basic Law – Article 1 and 20**
- **South African Constitution – Section 37**
- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)**

---

## 6. Accountability for Violation

- Violation of non-derogable rights constitutes:
  - A **constitutional crime**
  - Grounds for disqualification from office
  - Personal liability for **civil and criminal punishment**

---

## 7. Public Awareness and Education

- Every citizen shall be educated on their **non-negotiable rights**
- Emergency handbooks, school curriculums, and public messaging must include these rights as **untouchable constitutional guarantees**

---

## 8. Vision

The Republic of Equality recognizes that no security, no stability, and no ideology is worth the **cost of losing our core humanity**.
