## 2. Types of Emergencies

## 8. Comparative Inspirations

Inspired by:
- **Germany** (Basic Law Article 20) – core rights non-suspendable  
- **South Africa** – strict court oversight of emergencies  
- **India (Post-1975 reforms)** – strengthened checks post-Emergency abuse  
- **USA** – strong judicial role in limiting state overreach

## 9. Vision

Emergencies must never be an excuse for authoritarianism.  
In the Republic of Equality, crisis governance is built on **transparency, limits, and justice**.
