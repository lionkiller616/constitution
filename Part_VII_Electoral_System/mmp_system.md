# Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP) Representation System

## 1. Overview

The **Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)** system combines the **best features of First-Past-The-Post (FPTP)** and **Proportional Representation (PR)** to create a **fair, representative, and accountable democracy**.

MMP ensures:
- Local representation through constituencies
- Fair party representation in proportion to total votes
- Reduction in vote wastage and gerrymandering

---

## 2. Structure

### a. Two Votes per Voter
Each voter casts **two votes**:
1. **Constituency Vote**: To elect a local candidate (FPTP)
2. **Party Vote**: To vote for a political party (PR)

### b. Dual Representation in Legislature
- Half of the seats filled through **direct elections** in constituencies
- Half of the seats filled through **party lists**, based on the share of the party vote

---

## 3. Proportional Balance Mechanism

- The **total number of seats** a party receives is determined by the **party vote**
- If a party wins **fewer constituencies than its vote share**, it receives **compensatory seats** from its party list
- This ensures that **total representation matches total support**

> Example: If Party A wins 20% of votes but only 10 constituency seats, it receives 10 more list seats to match its 20% entitlement

---

## 4. Constituency Representation (FPTP)

- Nation/State is divided into **geographically defined constituencies**
- Each elects **one local representative** by simple majority
- Encourages **local accountability and direct connection** between people and representatives

---

## 5. Party List Representation (PR)

- Parties submit **ranked candidate lists** before elections
- List seats are distributed according to **total national/statewide vote share**
- Encourages **inclusion of women, minorities, and underrepresented groups**

> Constitutional requirement: Each party list must ensure **at least 33% women**, **15% SC/ST**, and **10% LGBTQ+/disabled** candidates

---

## 6. Threshold Clause

- To qualify for party-list seats, a party must receive **at least 3% of the national/statewide party vote**
- Prevents extreme fragmentation while allowing small parties to grow

---

## 7. Benefits of MMP

✅ **Proportional fairness**: Seats match votes  
✅ **Local connection**: Keeps local representatives accountable  
✅ **Reduced polarization**: Parties must appeal to wider audience  
✅ **Diverse representation**: List seats ensure marginalized voices  
✅ **Minimal vote waste**: Almost every vote counts
