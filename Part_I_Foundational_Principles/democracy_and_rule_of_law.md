# Democracy and Rule of Law

## 1. Definition and Core Principle

The Republic of Equality is founded upon the inseparable pillars of **Democracy** and the **Rule of Law**, ensuring that:

- All power emanates from the people.
- The government exists to serve, not to rule.
- No individual or authority is above the law — including legislators, executives, police, military, and judiciary.
- The Constitution is the supreme legal authority guiding the entire democratic process.

## 4. Checks and Balances

The Republic shall operate through a clear separation of powers:

| Organ        | Function                      | Limitation                                |
|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Legislature  | Makes laws                    | Cannot override fundamental rights         |
| Executive    | Implements laws               | Accountable to Legislature and Judiciary   |
| Judiciary    | Interprets laws, protects rights | Cannot make laws, must follow Constitution |

These branches shall monitor and balance one another to **prevent tyranny or corruption**.
