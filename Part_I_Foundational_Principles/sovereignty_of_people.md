# Sovereignty of the People

## 1. Foundational Principle

The **ultimate authority and legitimacy** in the Republic of Equality shall rest with the **People**.  
All laws, institutions, and governance systems derive their power **from the consent of the governed** — not from monarchs, corporations, military, religious institutions, or any elite class.

> "We, the People, are the makers and guardians of the Constitution — not passive subjects, but active citizens."
