# Right to Equality and Dignity

## 1. Introduction

The Right to Equality and Dignity is the cornerstone of a just society.  
Every human being is born equal in rights and worth — regardless of caste, class, gender, religion, language, ethnicity, ability, or background.

> “Equality is not sameness. It is justice.  
> Dignity is not charity. It is a right.”

This right ensures not just **equal treatment**, but **equal respect** in public, private, legal, and institutional life.

- **Discrimination based on disability, birth, or economic status**

Discriminatory behavior — by individuals, groups, organizations, or the State — shall be punishable under law.

## 10. Affirmation

> “I am not higher. You are not lower.  
> We are all human. We are all equal.”

This Constitution affirms that **true democracy begins with equal dignity** — not just in law, but in everyday life.

We commit to building a society where no one must fight to prove they are equal.
