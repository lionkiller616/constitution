# Social and Economic Rights

## 1. Introduction

Social and Economic Rights are essential to real freedom — the freedom to live, learn, work, grow, and thrive with dignity.  
Without access to **health, education, housing, food, and work**, civil liberties become hollow.

These rights are not aspirational—they are enforceable, guaranteed, and backed by the Constitution.
